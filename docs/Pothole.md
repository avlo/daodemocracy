## For each of the 4 above (circle) outcomes:
### 1) Pothole fixed and voters are happy
**a**) Good result for voters.  
**b**) Good result for betters who accurately predicted voters will be happy with fixed pothole.  These betters are rewarded a financial gain- an incentive to participate again and continue predicting satisfaction poll accurately.  
**c**) Bad result for betters who inaccurately predicted voters will be unhappy with fixed pothole. These betters take a financial loss, an incentive to predict satisfaction poll more accurately next time (or not bet at all).  
**d**) All participants incentivized to remember the proposal writer.  That person makes good proposals and participants might stand to make a profit betting on his proposals in the future.  


### 2) Pothole fixed and voters are unhappy
**a**) Bad result for voters.  
**b**) Good result for betters who accurately predicted voters will be unhappy with fixed pothole.  These betters are rewarded a financial gain- an incentive to participate again and continue predicting satisfaction poll accurately.  
**c**) Bad result for betters who inaccurately predicted voters will happy with fixed pothole. These betters take a financial loss, an incentive to predict satisfaction poll more accurately next time (or not bet at all).  
**d**) All participants incentivized to remember the proposal writer.  Writer makes bad proposals and we might stand to make a profit betting against his proposals in the future.  
**e**) Someone may choose to resubmit the proposal to put the pothole back.  Market participants will have new 2a-2d knowledge to better inform the resubmitted betting opportunity.  


### 3) Pothole not fixed and voters are happy
**a**) Good result for voters.  
**b**) Good result for betters who accurately predicted voters will be happy with unfixed pothole, these betters are rewarded a financial gain.  
**c**) Bad result for betters who inaccurately predicted voters will unhappy with unfixed pothole. These betters take a financial loss, which is incentive to either pick more wisely next time or not place a bet.  
**d**) All participants incentivized to remember the proposal writer.  Writer person makes bad proposals that.  Market participants might stand to make some $ betting against him in the future.  
**e**) Someone may now choose to ***resubmit*** the proposal to fix the pothole, but given new 3a-3d knowledge, it's ***likely to be a losing bet again*** (and therefore less likely to be submitted).  


### 4) Pothole not fixed and voters are unhappy
**a**) Bad result for voters.  
**b**) Good result for betters who accurately predicted voters will be unhappy with ongoing pothole.  These betters are rewarded a financial gain- an incentive to participate again and continue predicting satisfaction poll accurately.  
**c**) Bad result for betters who inaccurately predicted voters will happy with ongoing pothole. These betters take a financial loss, an incentive to predict satisfaction poll more accurately next time (or not bet at all).  
**d**) All participants incentivized to remember the proposal writer.  Writer makes good proposals, the voters wanted the pothole fixed, so betters might stand to make a profit betting on writer in the future.  
**e**) Someone may now choose to ***resubmit*** the proposal to fix the pothole, and given new 3a-3d knowledge, it's ***likely to be a winning outcome for voters and "for" betters next time*** (and therefore more likely to be submitted).  

 *(note: it may seem #1 & #4 are equivalent, as are #2 & #3, but there are nuanced differences that although pedantic/unncessary for a human, are expressed explicitly written out this way because IT'S SIMPLE TO PROGRAM INTO AN ALGORITHM.)*
