## What is DAO Democracy?
A democratic governance evolution beyond existing & ongoing shortcomings and inefficiencies.

An extension of DAO ([Decentralized Autonomous Organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_autonomous_organization)), DAO Democracy was proposed in a [whitepaper](https://merkle.com/papers/DAOdemocracyDraft.pdf) by computer scientist and cryptographer [Ralph Merkle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Merkle) with predictive market component by economist [Robin Hanson](https://mason.gmu.edu/~rhanson/futarchy.html).

## Motivation
- The average person is better at measuring their happiness about a decision *after* it is made rather than *before*.
- Intelligent/motivated people participation incentivized by profitable problem solving.
- A DAO replaces representative (ie., congress / director / managerial) process.
- Laws/rules written into digital contracts.  Programmable, public, immutable and persistent against any individual, group or external system.
- Anachronize bureaucratic cost, time, overhead & resource waste.
- Programmatic self-correction.

## How does DAO Democracy work?
DAO Democracy is composed of two phases, a ```Prediction Market``` and  ```Voter Satisfaction Poll```.

### Phase 1 - Prediction Market:
Software mechanism as follows:  
1. Accepts and registers submitted proposals.  
2. Creates a "for" and "against" bet/instrument for that proposal.  
3. Accepts bets on the proposal, escrows (holds) "betters" money & manages betting time-window.
4. Instructs DAO to trigger majority "bet" into law.
5. Financially incentivizes better proposal submissions and market-participant predictions as a function of voter satisfaction.

### Phase 2 - Voter Satisfaction Poll:
After some (pre-determined) time, voters are asked to rate their satisfaction of a given law.  Based on their collective vote:  
1. The law is either kept "as is" or repealed  
    ***and***  
2. The prediction market escrow settles bets as follows:  
    - Profits paid to betters that accurately predicted voter satisfaction  
    ***and***  
    - Losses taken from betters who inaccurately predicted voter satisfaction.  
3. Voter satisfaction poll data now available to market participants & the process starts over.

This iterative mechanism contianually better informs the competitive proposal market, resulting in increasingly desirable outcomes for voters and systematic self-correction otherwise.

## Examples and Goals

### Example 1
#### [Fixing the Pothole](/docs/Pothole.md) ####

### Example 2
#### Team operational process within a company:
Anyone in the company can submit a proposition for what process the team should follow when doing work.  Anyone in the company can then wager on (the satisfaction outcome of) that proposition, after which the majority "for" vote is adopted by the team.  After some time, a satisfaction vote is taken of team members and the result pays out accurate prediction market bets at the expense of inaccurate market bets.
#### Goal:
After (several/many/etc) iterations, this mechanism continually guides the team closer to desired process outcomes more efficiently than decisions made by managers/etc.  Continuous  iterations are not only good for the team, but likely also gain attention in other teams with adoption potential if deemed useful.

### Example 3
#### Company employee promotion/pay-increase rules:
Anyone in the company can submit a proposition for promotion/pay-increase conditions.  Anyone in the company can then wager on (the satisfaction outcome of) that proposition, after which the majority "for" vote is adopted by the company.  After some time, a satisfaction vote is taken of the company and the result pays out accurate prediction market bets at the expense of inaccurate market bets.
#### Goal:
After (serveral/many/etc) iterations this mechanism continually guides the company closer to equitable promotion rules more efficiently than decisions made by HR/managers/etc.  Furthermore, well-tested promotion processes will likely increase adoption potential by other companies if deemed useful.

### Example 4
#### City/Town council:
Any resident of that town can submit a proposition for a law the town should adopt.  Anyone in the town can then wager on (the satisfaction outcome of) that proposition, after which the majority "for" vote is adopted into law.  After some time, a satisfaction vote is taken of town residents and the result pays out accurate prediction market bets at the expense of inaccurate market bets.
#### Goal
After (serveral/many/etc) iterations this mechanism continually guides the city/town closer to favorable laws more efficiently than laws exclusively drafted by and voted on by council members.  Continuous successful iterations will likely gain attention in other towns/cities/counties/states with adoption potential if deemed useful.
