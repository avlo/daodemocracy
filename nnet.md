historically, destructive behavior by a single individual against his society/environment has disproportionately low consequences for the destructive individual yet comes at high cost to his society/environment.  largely because the destructive individual assumes little-to-no risk (financially, reputably, etc) for their destructive behavior.

a potentail rememdy for this is a social value / social currency / reputation network/layer, refered to below as "nnet"

on nnet, social value/currency (aka, reputation) is based on two factors:

* one's time, an individual's fundamental asset
* one's reputation, an individual's social currency

one’s value of his own time is his skin in the game.  from one's own time one shall risk- for gain or for loss- their reputation on the network.

nnet measures an individual's dependability/accountability and that information is available to all on the network.  participants enter contracts/interactions committing their future time for payment/goods/services/etc to others on the network.  as contracts are fulfilled, both parties increase in reputation.  as contracts are agreeably or "oracle" violated, the violating party decreases its reputation.  as contracts are debated without objective evidence (aka, stalemate) one party is less likely to engage in future contracts with the other, which although is a future-potential-loss for the both parties in the case at hand, when chronic, will systematically lower the reputation of the offending party.

new participants will have opportunity to grow/learn/etc, over time becoming more dependable and therefore increasing their reputation.  it's real-time, positive-reinforced reward system.

a decrease in one's reputation leads to decrease in value of their future time.  they progress towards undependability.  negative-punishment system.

the progressively dependable, having pursued ongoing successful contracts will increase their reputation and opportunity.  brings entities closer together whose incentives are aligned.

the progressively undependables will progressively drive themselves to lower reputation, inevitably down among other chronic undependables where effect of their behaviors is localized to each other (and not onto dependables) to reap- by their own doing- the fruits of their chosen actions.

this is an attempt at applied accountability.  to mitigate risk from shitty people at the same time providing a framework to incentivize them to grow out of their shittiness.  it's important to note, nnet also has the possiblity for “practice mode” where one can even make commitments to themselves with their own time such that they can learn, without consequence to others, how to manage their time/resources and so become better equipped and incentivized to mutually beneficial interactions.
